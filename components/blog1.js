            in less time than it would take with a hot air balloon. If we were
            to compare hot air balloon and helicopter ride in Dubai, hot air
            balloon would definitely win the game. Helicopter is expensive, and
            there’s no old-world charm or the slow panoramic view in helicopter
            rides that hot air balloons offer. If you are wondering about aerial
            views in Dubai- balloon or helicopter, hot air balloons would always
            be the best option in every aspect because they are convenient,

            helicopters. A hot air balloon ride is surely a leisurely and fun
            way to travel. When exploring a magnificent destination like Dubai
