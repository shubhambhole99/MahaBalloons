          <h3 className={styles.text2}>An Overview of Hot Air Balloon Ride</h3>
          <div className={styles.text1}>
            The hot air balloon adventure is an activity that involves flying at
            a height of nearly 1,000 to 4,000 feet above the ground and
            witnessing the scenic views of Dubai. Before the adventure starts,
            the expert crew members will provide you with a brief of what will
            happen. Also, they will offer you tips and precautions to enhance
            hot air balloon ride safety. Once you understand the instructions,
            you will climb the balloon basket. The balloon is gradually filled
            with hot air and the basket will start lifting from the ground. When
            the balloon reaches a certain height, all the sound fades away and
            you will be able to hear only the sound of the burner. From the top,
            you will get to enjoy a bird’s eye view of the dunes below and clear
            skies above.
