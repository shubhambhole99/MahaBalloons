        en: "For a hot air balloon ride, it’s best to dress in comfortable, casual clothing. Since the temperature can be cool in the early morning (when most rides occur), it’s advisable to wear layers that you can adjust as the day warms up. Closed-toe shoes like sneakers are ideal, as you may need to walk on uneven terrain during landing. Sunglasses and a hat can also help protect against the sun as the balloon ascends.",
